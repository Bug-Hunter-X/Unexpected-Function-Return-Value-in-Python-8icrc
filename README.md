This repository contains a simple Python function that demonstrates an uncommon bug: an unexpected return value. The function `function(x)` is intended to add 1 to its input and return the result. However, due to a potential logic error, it may return an unexpected value.

The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version.
